Presto - Business Client Recommendations
========================================

Client entertainment is the key to the beginning of a great, long-lasting relationship. The quality of this relationship isn't about lavishness but making this experience personal.

This is what Presto is all about. It allows all business personnels to access clients' interests through salesforce's database, and makes a recommendation for entertainment based on their preferences. In addition to location, Presto also takes into account the budget and amount of time available for a certain activity, all on one page! Presto not only saves time, but also delivers

With the creation of Presto, we hope to help businesses establish long-lasting relationships with clients to deliver the best client experience.

We have some awesome team members:
